# The Holy Torus
A 481 lined program in go that simulates a spinning torus.
To toggle VSYNC on/off (on by default) use V
On Steamdeck (my main "pc"/thing I used to develop this) got around 8500 fps without VSYNC.
Precompiled binaries for linux and windows are availiable.
Linux: Holy-Torus-Linux
Windows: Holy-Torus-Win.exe
