# THE HOLY CUBE
This is a 480 lined go program that runs a spinning cube.
To toggle VSYNC off to obtain godly fps, click V.
This is tested for both linux and windows.
Linux preforms significantly better!
On my steamdeck (My main "pc", that I also used to develop this)
Got around 9000-10000 fps without VSYNC.
On windows, my friend's computer, got around 2000-3000 fps without VSYNC.
Precompiled versions are:
Linux: Holy-Cube-Linux
Windows: Holy-Cube-win.exe
